# Intro-to-Machine-Learning
Make great data visualizations. A great way to see the power of coding!

### Basic Data Exploration
* Load and understand your data.
### Building First Machine Learning
* Building our first model.
### Model Validation
* Measure the performance of your model, so you can test and compare alternatives.
### Underfitting or Overfitting
* Fine-tune your model for better performance.
### Random Forests
* Using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm.

# Intermediate-to-Machine-Learning
Handle missing values, non-numeric values, data leakage, and more.

### Introduction
* Review what you need for this course.
### Missing Values
* Three approaches to dealing with missing values.
### Categorical Variables
* There's alot of non-numeric data out there. Here's how to use it for Machine Learning.
### Pipelines
* Pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.
### Cross Validation
* A better way to test our model.
### XGBoost
* The most accurate modeling technique for structured data.
### Data Leakage
* Find and fix this problem that ruins your model in subtle way.
